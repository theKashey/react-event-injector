-----
Declarative React event manager, slim as 1kb. 
Uses _standard_ addEventListener underneath, and able to overpass current [React API Limitations](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436).

Please - don't overuse this library, as long "React" way to attach events is
far more performant, and better working with React itself. 

# API
There is 3 Components, exported from this package
- `EventInjector` - to inject events somewhere down the tree
- `PassiveListener` - to inject "passive" events, which could be quite useful to make application run smoothly. 
- `ActiveListener` - to inject __non__ "passive" events, as long some events are passive by default.
- `TargetedInjector` - to inject events to the specific target.

All components will add events on `mount`, remove on `unmount`, and update changed on `update` if `pure` is not set.

# Why
- üòÄ to inject passive events. There is no way to inject them in "react-way".
- üòÄ to inject events where you need, without relaying on bubbling or capturing or some react details.
- ‚òπÔ∏è to get native DOM event, not React.Synthetic.
- ‚òπÔ∏è to work with DOM Tree, not React.Tree.

## Injection API

### Children as React Element
- You may provide a single __tag__, as a children, or use `forwardRef` to forward ref to the proper target.
```js
import {EventInjector} from 'react-event-injector';
<EventInjector onClick={event}>
 <div>It will inject onClick on me, please pass a SINGLE and HTML tag inside injector</div>
</EventInjector> 
```

- Capture events are also supported
```js
import {EventInjector} from 'react-event-injector';
<EventInjector 
    onClick={event}
    // capture events are also supported
    onKeydownCapture={event} 
    // explicity set passive:false to all events. Better set to true
    settings={{passive:false}}
>
 <div>It will inject onClick on me, please pass a SINGLE and HTML tag inside injector</div>
</EventInjector> 
```
- You may nest Injectors one inside another. Injectors __is the only way__ to combine,
`passive`, `active`, and `neutral` event listeners.
> All injectors implements EventTarget interface, and could be `ref`-ed by another injectors.
```js
import {PassiveListener, EventInjector} from 'react-event-injector';
<PassiveListener onScroll={event}>
  <EventInjector onClick={event}>
    <EventInjector onKeydownCapture={event}>
      <div>It will inject onClick on me, please pass a SINGLE and HTML tag inside injector</div>
    </EventInjector>
  </EventInjector>  
</PassiveListener>
```

### Children as RenderProp
You may provide a single __tag__, as a children, or use `forwardRef` to forward ref to the proper target.
```js
import {EventInjector} from 'react-event-injector';
<EventInjector onClick={event}>
 { setRef => (
 <div ref={setRef}>
   It will inject onClick on me</div>
 }  
</EventInjector> 
```

`EventInjector`, `ActiveListener` and `PassiveListener` has the same API, and accept only `children` and any on-`event`, or on-`event`-Capture, as any HTML tag does.
The difference is default value for `settings`. 

## TargetedInjector
- Inject events to any `target` provided:
```js
import {TargetedInjector} from 'react-event-injector';
<TargetedInjector 
onClick={event}
target={this.ref}
>  
``` 
- You may use function as a target
```js
import {TargetedInjector} from 'react-event-injector';
<TargetedInjector 
onClick={event}
target={() => document.querySelector('#element-i-need')}
>  
``` 
In the case of a function, `target` would be executed twice - on componentDidMount, and right after it,
 thus it will be able to inject events to sibling elements, not existing on mount.



# Inspiration
- `TargetedInjector` is quite similar to [react-event-listener](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-event-listener).
- `PassiveListener` is quite similar to [default-passive-events](https://github.com/zzarcon/default-passive-events)
